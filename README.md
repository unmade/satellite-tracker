# WebGl Elektro-L Tracker app

![Main page](demo/main.png?raw=true)

This project is dedicated to the three launched satellites manufactured by [NPO Lavochkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavochkin):
- [Elektro-L No.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektro-L_No.1)
- [Elektro-L No.2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektro-L_No.2)
- [Spektr-R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spektr-R)

You could see satellites position in real-time or travel back and forth in time.

Here is comparing between rendered and real image made on 2011-03-18.

> I don't have permission to use the actual Elektro-L model, so instead the demo uses Aqua model as Elektro-L
and Jason-1 model as Spektr-R.
